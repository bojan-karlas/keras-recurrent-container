fff
The `RecurrentContainer` class unlocks the following scenarios that are currently not possible in Keras:
- Multiple input and/or multiple output sequences.
- Arbitrary state tensors which can hold states for `Recurrent` layers, but also outputs from previous timesteps that can be fed back into the network.
-
